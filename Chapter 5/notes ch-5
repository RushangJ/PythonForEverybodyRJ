-------Iteration-------

while statement:

1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False.
2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at
the next statement.
3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.

*Loops and Iteration:Loops (repeted steps) have iteration varieables that change
                     each time through a loop. Often this teration variables go
                     through a sequence of numbers.

*break: The  break  statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement
        immediately following the loop.

*continue: The continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top
            of the loop and starts the next iteration.

*Definite loop: Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables
                that change each time through  loop. This  iteration variables
                move through the sequence or set.
