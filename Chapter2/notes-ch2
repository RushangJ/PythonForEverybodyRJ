*type(): If you are not sure that type a value has, the interpreter can tell
         you.

*Types of variable: String- str
                   Integer- int
                   Float- float

*operators: *,_,+,%,

* Order of Evaluation: When we string operators together python know which one
                       to do first.
                       This is called "operator precedence"
        Example:

        x= 1+2*3-4/5**6   Order:1) (5**6)
                                2) (4/180)=45
                                3)  (2*3)=6
                                4)   1+6-45

      * Operator's precedences rules :

        -Parentheses are always respected
        -Exponentiation (raise to a power)
        -Multiplication, Division, and reminder
        -Addition and Subtraction
        -Left to right

*mnemonic: A memory aid. We often give variables mnemonic names to help us
           remember what is stored in the variable.
