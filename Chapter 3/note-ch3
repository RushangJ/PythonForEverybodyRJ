Boolean expressions ask a question and produce a Yes or No result which we use
to control program flow.

< less then
<= less then  equal to
== is  ?
= used for assignment

*Logical operator:

There are 3 logical operator: and
                              or
                              not

* Conditional execution: if

* Alternative execution: if else

* Chained Conditional: if  elif  else

* Nested condition: if else else  (One condition can be nested within another)

* The try/except structure:

-If the code in the try works- the except skipped
-If the code in try fails- it jumps to the except section 5
