*3 general types of errors:

1) Syntax errors: means that you have violated the "grammar" rules of python.

2) Logic errors: A mistake in the order of the statement or perhaps a mistake
                 in how the statement related to one another.

3) Semantic errors: When your description of the steps to take is syntactically
                    perfect and in the right order, but there is simply a mistake
                    in the program.

*Debugging:

reading
v
running <running different versions>
v
ruminating <Take some time to think what kind of error is it!>
v
retreating <undoing recent changes, until you get back to program that works>

Exercise:
1) C. Store information for long term even beyond power cycle

2) sequence of statement that have been crafted to do something.

3) An interpreter reads the source code and interprets right away. A compiler
   needs the entire program file before running, translating from high-level
   language to machine level language and then putting in a separate file to
   execute later.

4) A. Python interpreter

5) spelling wrong and missing ()

6) B. Main memory

7) B. 44

8)Central Processing Unit: Like the human brain? -Main Memory: Your short
  term-memory -Secondary Memory: Your long-term memory -Input Device: You
  ears when listening or putting food in your body -Output Device:
  Your mouth when speaking

9) check grammar
